WordPress is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## Renerate 2048 bit DH Param file
- openssl dhparam -out /WP/dh-param/dhparam-2048.pem 2048

## Run Docker
- sudo docker-compose up -d
